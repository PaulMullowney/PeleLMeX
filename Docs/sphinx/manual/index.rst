Welcome to PeleLMeX's documentation!
====================================

`PeleLMeX` is the non-subcycling version of `PeleLM <https://amrex-combustion.github.io/PeleLM/>`_, an adaptive-mesh low Mach number hydrodynamics
code for reacting flows. If you need help or have questions, please use the `GitHub discussion <https://github.com/AMReX-Combustion/PeleLMeX/discussions>`_.
The documentation pages appearing here are distributed with the code in the ``Docs`` folder as "restructured text" files.  The html is built
automatically with certain pushes to the `PeleLMeX` GibHub repository. A local version can also be built as follows ::

    cd ${PELE_HOME}/Docs
    make html

where ``PELE_HOME`` is the location of your clone of the `PeleLMeX` repository.  To view the local pages,
point your web browser at the file ``${PELE_HOME}/Docs/build/html/index.html``.
